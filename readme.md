Playing with Snakes
===================

When I was teaching, I wanted to avoid using a traditional textbook, and instead provide a resource online that students could never forget to take home with them.

Unfortunately, the software I wrote to generate the pages has been lost, as has the source of the illustrations. Someday I may rewrite this for Jekyll.
